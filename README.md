# Air-Quality-Prediction-Using-Time-Series-Analysis
This project predicts hourly concentrations of air pollutants (CO, NMHC, Benzene, NOx, NO2) for the next 48 hours using a dataset of chemical sensor responses. It utilizes time series modeling and RMSE validation to ensure accuracy, incorporating data preprocessing and feature engineering to improve forecast reliability.
